# Rust Client for Flic Linux SDK

This repo contains a Rust library crate for interacting with Shortcut Labs
Linux service, which in turn interacts with Flic buttons. The main repo for
that service is https://github.com/50ButtonsEach/fliclib-linux-hci

This is my first attempt at writing Rust code, all critiques, suggestions, and
comments are welcome!
